This is a simple tap-and-blast game in progress.

Game Basics:
- There are four types (colors) of Cubes. At least 2 adjacent (non-diagonal) cubes with the same color can be blasted by tapping any cube in the group.

- New random cubes fall from atop the grid upon blast.

- Obstacles are goals of levels. Users should clear all obstacles to win the level within a given move count. There are three types of obstacles. The level will be won if all obstacles are cleared within a given move count.

Notes:
Please start the game from the scene labeled as "StartScene" and make sure that GameObject "GameManager" is active in scene before doing so.

Couple of current bugs that the user should be aware of:

1) To progress to the next level, user should restart application after winning.

2) User should attempt another blast after victory move for victory to be recognized.

Victory and level progression are possible, given that they're performed as instructed above.
