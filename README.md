This is a simple tap-and-blast game that adheres to the specifics provided in the case file.

Please start the game from the scene labeled as "StartScene" and make sure that GameObject "GameManager" is active in scene before doing so.

Couple of bugs that the user should be aware of:

1) To progress to the next level, user should restart application after winning.

2) User should attempt another blast after victory move for victory to be recognized.

Victory and level progression are possible, given that they're performed as instructed above.
